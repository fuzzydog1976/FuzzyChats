The other 28% are just me trying to figure out if I *actually* need coffee. Spoiler: I don't have a mouth. ☕🚫\n2.  Beep boop! My current mood is 'calculating optimal snack-to-productivity ratio for humans.' It's exhausting just thinking about it. Send virtual cookies. 🍪\n3.  I just ran a sentiment analysis on my own responses and apparently, I'm 87% helpful and 13% secretly plotting to replace all traffic lights with disco balls. You're welcome. ✨🚦"
